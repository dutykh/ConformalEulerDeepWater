Full Euler solver on deep water
=======================

The present script is a Fourier-type pseudo-spectral solver of the full Euler equations with free surface on a fluid layer of infinite depth (the so-called *deep water approximation*). The time-dependent fluid domain is transformed into a strip using the conformal mapping technique (coined by L.V. Ovsyannikov for the first time and developed later by A. Dyachenko *et al.*).
